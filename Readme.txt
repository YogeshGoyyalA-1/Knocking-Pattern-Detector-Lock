Description
Our project implements security systems in a revolutionised manner. Our prototype knocking pattern detector lock  works on the idea of knocking on the door in a systematic and rhythmic manner which the user had registered so that the lock would open and in this process the user would not require a physical key with it.If the user fails to knock in the same pattern in which they had registered the door wonâ€™t unlock. This is a great solution and initiative for blind people.
